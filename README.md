Set your windRiver workspace to the cloned repository. I already have a workspace set up. 

Team1257Code: Competition code

Team1257MoreCode: A project I am using for practice-project code

SimpleTemplate: I think it's Rohan's code

Conway'sGameOfLife: I should take that down (nothing in it)

Conway'sGameOfLife(Example): for next year's freshmen
